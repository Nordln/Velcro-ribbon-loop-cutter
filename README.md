# Velcro-ribbon-loop-cutter

An one-part velcro strip cutter. Made out of frustration with velcro cable ties not reliably staying on cables. Uses 10mm dual-side velcro tape and standard Stanley 11-300 blades. Each single blade slots in to the model base.  Depending on your printer's tolences, blades may need a drop of glue or holes widening to a small degree. When bladed, simple feed the tape through the rear feed over the blade tips, into the forward feed slot, and out the front. 

STLs generated from a fully parameterized model, so many adjustments are possible. Can be made as one print with in-place printed hinge, or as two prints with an added hinge bolt.
